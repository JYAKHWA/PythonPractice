A complete Azure Data Engineering and Analytcis Project for 2021 Olympic Data.

STEPS TAKEN.
A. DATA ENGINEERING (Azure databricks, datafactory, datalake)
B. DATA ANALYTICS (Azure Synapse)

A basic workflow is given below. (DATA ENGINEERING)

First (Source)
1. Data Source (Github Raw Data HTTP)

Second (Extract)
2. Ingest the raw data to Azure Data Factory creating pipeline. Then,storing to DataLake, in a container.

Third (Transform)
1. Use Data Bricks where data transformation and cleaning is done in Notebook using PySpark.

Fourth (Load)
1. the transformed data is loaded back to the gen2 data lake. This data is now ready for further analysis.

DATA ANALYTICS (SYNAPSE)

1. Data Analysis and exploration in Azure Synase. Visualized in Synapse, Power BI for dashboard.
